          Our design tokens are a set of css variables, which were deduced by
          one big .json file defined in @northlight/tokens. This file has then
          been parsed by{ ' ' }

          . We export multiple themes, as of currenetly theme(light mode) and
          tottTheme(dark mode). You can customize and put together your own
          theme.

        <P>
          The component tokens are meant for internal usage inside the library,
          ex: "color.button.danger.hover". The system tokens, which are also
          under the component token menu, are prefixed with "st", these can
          change from theme to theme. Ex: "st.border.radius.md".
        </P>
        <P>
          Global reference tokens are token values which are consistent across all
          themes, for example: "blue.500"
        </P>
        <P>
          As a note you should always try to use the system tokens. If there is
          some occurence where you can't use them, you can open an issue or PR
          and we'd be glad to extend our token range.
