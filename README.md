# Northlight

Northlight is an open source UI framework built by Mediatool. It is based on Chakra UI and uses design tokens, making it easy to customize the look and feel of your application.

## Local sandbox

To start up a local sandbox environment of the Northlight UI framework:

1. Clone this repository
2. cd into the directory
3. run `pnpm`
4. cd into `/framework`
5. run `pnpm nx demo`

This will spin up a local environment sandbox at localhost:3008 (or the first available port after that)

## Usage

To get started with Northlight, you will need to install `@northlight/ui` from npm:

Once installed, you can then import the different components from Northlight into your application. Here is an example of a basic button component:

```js
import { Button } from '@northlight/ui'
```
